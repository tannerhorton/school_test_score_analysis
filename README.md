# Student Reading and Math Testing Score Analysis 
In this assignment, I will  create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

## Project Overview:
This data analysis project aims to examine and gain insights into student reading and math testing scores in different schools. The dataset contains information about various schools, including their type (charter or public), size, budget, and other relevant details. The primary goal is to identify any patterns or correlations between school characteristics and academic performance, particularly in reading and math scores.

## Project Structure:
The dataset consists of the following columns:

School ID: A unique identifier for each school.
school_name: The name of the school.
type: The type of school (charter or district/public).
size: The total number of students enrolled in the school.
budget: The budget allocated to the school.
reading_scores: The average reading test scores of students in the school.
math_scores: The average math test scores of students in the school.
Data Analysis
The data analysis will involve the following steps:

## Objective:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Summary Statistics: Calculating summary statistics to get an overview of key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of reading and math scores.
Correlation Analysis: Examining the correlation between school characteristics (e.g., budget, size) and academic performance (reading and math scores).
Comparative Analysis: Comparing the performance of charter and district schools in terms of test scores and budget allocation.
Visualization: Creating visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to represent the findings effectively.
Project Files
The project will include the following files:


## Methodology:
data.csv: The dataset containing the school information and test scores.
data_analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis code in Python.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Requirements
To run the data analysis code, you need the following software/libraries:

## Requirements:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
NumPy
Usage
Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries using pip or any package manager of your choice.
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the data_analysis.ipynb file.
Run the cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis step-by-step.

## Conclusion:
The data analysis project will provide valuable insights into student performance in reading and math tests across different school types, sizes, and budgets. The findings will help educators and policymakers make data-driven decisions to enhance educational outcomes and resource allocation.
